    "Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, remote work has been on the rise globally (Brynjolfsson, E. et al., 2020). This drastic change in the way companies operate poses numerous challenges and opportunities for both employers and employees. Given the potential increases in productivity (Galanti, Teresa et al., 2021) among remote workers and the obvious decrease in operating costs for companies, it would be insightful to see if these factors point to a difference in salaries among data science professionals. Since the nature of most data science jobs allows fully remote work, it would be informative to look at salary differences between fully-remote and conventional work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises an interesting question: **does salary differ between full-remote and conventional positions for full-time data science professionals?** We will provide an estimate of the mean salary for both groups(remote and conventional workers) and conduct a two-sample t-test in an attepmt to provide evidence for there being a difference between the two groups. Given the skewed nature of the salaries in our dataset, we will use the inter-quartile range to quantify the spread of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our question, we discovered a dataset originally aggregated by [ai-jobs.net](https://salaries.ai-jobs.net/) through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries). This dataset includes 607 observations with 11 factors: year, experience level, full/part-time, job titles, salary values in different currencies, employees location, remote ratio, company locations, and company sizes (more detials see 2.2).  We take the `salary_in_usd` as our response variables and take `remote_ratio` as our explanatory variable."
